# Randle

Guess the 5 letter word in 5 tries, similar to Wordle ...with extras. Uses existing list of words so there no longer is a need to wait for more challenges. You can also create your own challenge with various settings. Also this is completely ad-free to keep you from being distracted.

Uses a mix of next.js and tailwindcss. Can run on static page and is flexible to be easily ported to native apps.
